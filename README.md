# Computer Science Graduate

Technical Skills: Python, C++, Git

### Education
B.S. - Computer Science University of California, Santa Barbara (_June 2023_)


### Experiences
UCSB Computer Science Capstone with Forta Network − Blockchain Rug-Pull Token Detector (_September 2022 – March 2023_)
- Partnered with mentors from Forta Network to create a detection algorithm for malicious rug-pull tokens on the Ethereum blockchain network
- Researched, designed, and implemented a series of heuristics using static abstract syntax tree analysis of deployed token smart contracts in Python
- Resulted in a 91.8% recall rate on a sample of known rug-pull contracts
- Deployed detector bot on the Forta Network detectors page for public use

### Projects
Farming Robotics Challenge (_February 2023 – June 2023_)
- Collaborated in a robotics team competition focused on agricultural automation of the Amiga robot provided by Farm_ng
- Designed and engineered a multipurpose data mule package on the Amiga utilizing Raspberry Pis which efficiently travels and collects farming data, such as temperature and humidity, from onfield Raspberry Pis sensors via Bluetooth
- Implemented a computer vision-based alignment system in Python and attached a Li-Fi laser-based charging system to the Amiga in order to precisely position the laser and charge in-field sensor batteries
- Managed and developed front-end applications utilizing Python and Kivy to organize and graph onboard data as well as display video and information on the computer vision alignment system

2048 Game AI (_November 2021 – December 2021_)
- Developed an AI in Python that plays 2048 utilizing the minimax search algorithm and a score heuristic consisting of a weighted tile matrix
- Optimized runtime utilizing alpha-beta pruning
- Resulted in an average game score of 2150

Mastermind Web Game (_January 2021_)
- Led a team during a 36-hour hackathon to create a web game
- Developed a Mastermind-type game where the player has several attempts to guess a specific order of colors. Each guess will provide the accuracy of the guess, leading to more educated guesses
- Utilized HTML and CSS for front-end visuals and Java for back-end game logic


### Research
Early Research Scholarship Program (_September 2021 – December 2021_)
- Focus: applying and implementing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm on electoral districting lines to uncover gerrymandering in U.S. state voting
- Generated non-partisan data utilizing the MCMC algorithm and compared the collected data with state voting results in order to determine the partisanship of state districting lines
